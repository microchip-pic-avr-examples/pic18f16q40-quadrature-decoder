# Quadrature Decoder with PIC18F16Q40
This code example creates a simple quadrature decoder implementation on the PIC18F16Q40 device. It utilizes the Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs): 2 of the Configurable Logic Cells (CLCs) and TMR1/2/3 to measure the quadrature. A UART interface is also used for a serial readout.
